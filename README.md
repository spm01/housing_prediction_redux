# housing_prediction_redux
Hi everyone! This is an updated version of my housing prediction using modern statistical learning techniques. 

My process is similar to my prior workflow, but this time I use 5-fold cross-validation and forward model selection to ensure a low Residual Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the best performing model.

For the first time, I also use a LASSO regression for additional assistance in model selection. This constrains (shrinks) the value of my coefficients based on an optimal lambda value as determined by my cross-validation. 

The PDF has the cleanest formatting!
